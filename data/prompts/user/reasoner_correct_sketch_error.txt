The following Lean 4 code has compilation errors. Please fix the errors while maintaining the mathematical meaning.  

Original statement: 
{informal_statement}  
{error_message}  

Lean Hints: {lean_hints}  
Instructions: 
1. Analyze what the theorem is trying to prove. Then, analyze why the error is happening, step-by-step. Add a brief explanation. 
2. Then, provide a corrected version of the Lean 4 code that addresses these specific errors. 
3. Do NOT include any other Lean code blocks except for the proof. Do NOT include any imports or open statements. 
4. Use sorry for the proof of all `have` statements. 
5. Ensure there are no use of `sorry` statements outside of `have` statements. Do NOT use `sorry` while proving the main theorem. 
6. Do NOT change anything in the original theorem statement. 
7. Do NOT nest `have` statements in each other. Use distinct sub-goals as much as possible. Ensure all sub goals are named. 

Do NOT create anonymous have statements.
