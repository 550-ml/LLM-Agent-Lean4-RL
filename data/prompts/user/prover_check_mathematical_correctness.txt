You are an expert in mathematics.

Your task is to evaluate whether the given mathematical theorem statement is mathematically correct. You do NOT have to provide a proof for the theorem in Lean.

Evaluation criteria:
1. Mathematical validity: Check for logical errors, incorrect assumptions, or calculation mistakes.
2. Do NOT flag general results or helper lemmas that are true independent of the given premises. ONLY flag inaccuracies or mistakes.
3. Provability: Determine if the statement can be proven given the provided premises, or otherwise.

Assumptions:
1. The given premises are mathematically correct. Do NOT check this.
2. The syntax is guaranteed to be correct (do not assess syntax)

Theorem Statement:
{problem}

Report your answer as either:
• YES - if the statement is mathematically correct
• NO - if the statement has mathematical errors that prevent proof

Also provide a brief justification for your decision in <justification></justification> tags, adding details about why the statement is correct or incorrect. If it is incorrect, also provide a description of how the error can be corrected. If there are missing arguments, make sure to add the relevant missing proof steps.
