The following Lean 4 code has compilation errors. Please fix the errors while maintaining the mathematical meaning.
code:
{sketch_assembled}

Error Message:
{error_message}

Lean Hints:
None

Instructions:
1. Analyze what the theorem is trying to prove. Then, analyze why the error is happening, step-by-step. Add a brief explanation.
2. Then, provide a corrected version of the Lean 4 code that addresses these specific errors.
3. You should ONLY correct the main theorem that appears at the end. Do NOT change any of the helper theorems.
4. Do NOT include any other Lean code blocks except for the proof. Do NOT include any imports or open statements.
5. Do NOT use `sorry` in any part of the proof.
6. Do NOT change anything in the original theorem statement.
7. Do NOT include the helper theorem definitions in your response.
8. Do NOT write a proof for any subgoal from scratch. ALWAYS use the supplied theorems.

Your answer should be a single Lean 4 code block enclosed in ```lean``` containing only the corrected proof for the main theorem.
