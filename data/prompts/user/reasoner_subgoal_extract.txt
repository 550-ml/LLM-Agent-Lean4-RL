From this proof sketch, extract any missing proofs (specified with `sorry`) as independent subgoals (theorems).

Instructions:
1. Use the same name as the have statements for the theorems.
2. Each subgoal should have the relevant context from the previous subgoals needed to simplify the proof as much as possible.
3. There should be as many extracted theorems as `sorry`s in the given theorem.
4. Do NOT include any imports or open statements. Do NOT add any definitions. ONLY include the theorem statement.
5. Use a separate Lean 4 ``lean`` block for each subgoal.
6. Use sorry for the proof. Do NOT prove any theorem.
7. Do NOT change the conclusion of the theorems from the extracted subgoals. Keep them AS IT IS.
8. Do NOT change the conclusions of the preceding theorems when presenting them as hypotheses for the next subgoals. Keep them AS IT IS.
9. Do NOT duplicate theorem names. Use distinct theorem names for the different theorems.
10. Make sure the names and types of the premises/arguments in the extracted theorems MATCH the subgoals from which they are extracted.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, allow division and subtraction operations on natural number literals with UNDEFINED types, unless REQUIRED by the theorem statement. For example, do NOT allow literals like `1 / 3` or `2 / 5` or `1 - 3` ANYWHERE in the theorem statement. ALWAYS specify the types. AVOID natural number arithmetic UNLESS NEEDED by the theorem statement. ALWAYS specify types when describing fractions. For example, ((2 : R) / 3) or ((2 : Q) / 3) instead of (2 / 3)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: Do NOT, under ANY circumstances, allow division and subtraction operations on variables of type natural numbers (Nat or N), unless REQUIRED by the theorem statement. For example, do NOT allow expressions like (a-b) or (a/b) where a, b are of type N. ALWAYS cast the variables to a suitable type (Z, Q or R) when performing arithmetic operations. AVOID natural number arithmetic UNLESS NEEDED by the theorem statement.
