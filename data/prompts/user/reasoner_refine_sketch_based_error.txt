You are an expert in writing Lean 4 proofs. You are given a Lean 4 proof sketch where one of the subgoals has some issues. Your task is to fix the issues and write a new proof sketch.

Proof Sketch:
{sketch}

Issues:
{error_message}

Lean Hints:
{lean_hints}

Rules:
1. Same proof level = same indentation: All tactics at the same logical level must use identical indentation
2. Consistent characters: Use either tabs OR spaces consistently (don't mix)
3. Proper nesting: Indent sub-proofs one level deeper than their parent
4. Do NOT nest `have` statements in each other. Write different have statements for different sub goals.
5. Ensure all sub goals are named. Do NOT create anonymous have statements.
6. Do NOT include any imports or open statements.
7. One line = One `have` subgoal. Do NOT split subgoals across different lines.
8. Use proper Lean 4 syntax and conventions. Ensure the proof sketch is enclosed in triple backticks ```lean```
9. Use `sorry` for all subgoal proofs - focus on structure, not implementation
10. **Do NOT use `sorry` for the main goal proof** - use your subgoals to prove it
11. NEVER use `sorry` IN the theorem statement itself
12. Ensure subgoals collectively provide everything needed for the main proof
13. Make the logical dependencies between subgoals explicit. Ensure that the subgoals are valid and provable in Lean 4.
14. Modify only the incorrect subgoal and everything that follows it in the proof sketch. Leave all preceding portions unchanged.
15. Either modify the problematic subgoals to fix the errors, or add additional subgoals to fill in the missing mathematical arguments.
